This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. I have also integrated a virtual assistant powered by the Gemini API to assist users in learning more about me and my work.

**Features**
Next.js Framework: This website is built using the powerful Next.js framework, which enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance.
Virtual Assistant: Powered by the Gemini API, the virtual assistant can help answer questions about me, my projects, and my skills.
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
Interactive Portfolio: Easily explore my projects and skills through an interactive layout.

**Tech Stack**
Frontend:
Next.js
Tailwind CSS (for styling)
Gemini API (for virtual assistance)
Backend:
Node.js (Next.js uses this as the backend for server-side functionality)

**Virtual Assistant Integration**
The virtual assistant is powered by the Gemini API, a conversational AI tool that helps users get to know more about me, including my background, skills, and projects. You can interact with it by typing questions into the chat window, and the assistant will respond with relevant information.

**How the Gemini API Works:**
The Gemini API is used to retrieve natural language responses based on user input. It processes questions and provides pre-configured answers based on the data I've input.
The assistant is designed to provide conversational insights into my career, including detailed project descriptions, skills, and technologies I'm proficient in.
